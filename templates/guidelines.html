                <p>Frank’s Calendar puts campus events in one place, and should be used to share events with the Olin community that are also being shared via other channels (carpe emails, flyers around campus, etc).</p>

                <p>Since Olin is a busy place and it would be impossible to capture everything happening on campus, Frank’s Calendar only advertises community-wide events.</p>
