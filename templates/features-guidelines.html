<h3>Types of Events</h3>

</p>
<ul>

<li>Events public to the <span class="underlined">whole Olin community</span>

<li>Events hosted by an <span class="underlined">Olin community member</span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These events don’t belong on Frank’s Calendar:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Events only open to a <span class="underlined">smaller group of people</span> (for example: classes, course specific office hours, club design reviews)

<li>Events hosted by <span class="underlined">non-Oliners</span>

<h3 id="moderating-events">Moderating Events</h3>


<p>
Calendar moderators maintain the events on the calendar to guarantee that Frank’s Calendar is populated with accurate, up to date information about what is happening on campus. They also monitor events to make sure they meet the requirements of what is okay to share.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns about an event or any information on the calendar, you can contact a moderator to resolve the issue.
</p>

<h3>How do events get filtered?</h3>


<p>
Events get filtered in two different ways:
</p>
<ul>

<li>If the event was published via a <em>calendar invite</em>, the database will check and see if it’s from an email sender that has an associated category
<ul>

<li>For instance, the Director of PGP’s email will be associated with the <mark class="student-affairs">PGP</mark> filter, so any events they send will automatically be tagged that way

<li>If they share an event that isn’t related to PGP, they need to <span class="underlined">contact the moderator</span> to have them manually change the associated category
</li>
</ul>

<li>If an event was published via the <em>online form</em>, the person will manually assign a category to the event before submitting it for approval
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are filter groups?</h3>


<p>
There are certain filter groups to shorten the long list of filters at first glance, and unite similar filters together under one comprehensive category. Below are explanations of the two filter groups we have:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Academic Affairs</strong>
<ul>

<li>Any event that is related to academics at Olin

<li>Sub-filters are <mark class="academic-affairs">Academic Calendar</mark> and <mark class=academic-affairs>Academic Advising</mark>
</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Student Affairs</strong>
<ul>

<li>Any event that is related to student affairs at Olin

<li>Sub-filters are <mark class="student-affairs">Residential</mark>, <mark class="student-affairs">Health & Wellness</mark>, <mark class="student-affairs">PGP</mark>, <mark class="student-affairs">HR</mark>, <mark class="student-affairs">Intl’ & Study Away</mark>, and <mark class="student-affairs">Diversity & Inclusion</mark>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Individuals associated with a filter</h3>


<p>
The list of individual filters is somewhat long, because Frank’s Calendar aimed to find a balance between detail and conciseness. Going back to how certain events are tagged automatically with a filter if shared via a calendar invite, below is an explanation for who’s emails are associated with which filters:
