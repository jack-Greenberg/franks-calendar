# Frank's Calendar

## How to collaborate
1. Fork this repository! This means you create your own version on your account that you own and can make changes to.
2. Start making changes to your fork. Once you make a significant change, make a commit and push to your remote.
3. Once you have a feature to implement (in the form of a series of commits), open a pull request on the [original repository](https://github.com/jack-greenberg/franks-calendar).
4. I'll check for merge conflicts, resolve any that come up, and then merge your request (this helps manage merge conflicts that are a pain to deal with on your own).
