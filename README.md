# Frank's Calendar

## How to collaborate
1. Fork this repository! This means you create your own version on your account that you own and can make changes to.
2. Start making changes to your fork. Once you make a significant change, make a commit and push to your remote.
3. Once you have a feature to implement (in the form of a series of commits), open a pull request on the [original repository](https://github.com/jack-greenberg/franks-calendar).
4. I'll check for merge conflicts, resolve any that come up, and then merge your request (this helps manage merge conflicts that are a pain to deal with on your own).

## Running the app
1. Create a virtual environment (run this after you have `cd`ed to the folder:
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment and install the packages:
```bash
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install the javascript packages:
```bash
$ npm install
```
4. Run the server:
```bash
$ npm run serve
```
5. Profit (go to http://localhost:5000)

### Additional Notes
* When editing the HTML files, put everything in between the {% block page %} and {% endblock %}. This will make sure it gets included when the page is loaded
* `tailwind.css` should take care of all CSS styling for you. [Go to this website to learn more about it](https://tailwindcss.com)
