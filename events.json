The high energy consumption arises from the inefficiencies of using digital processors for data processing. Inspired by the energy-efficient human brain, we use analogue approaches which are 100-1000 times more energy efficient than optimized digital processors. Here, we compute directly using materials with a known resistance combining Ohm‚Äôs Law and Kirchoff‚Äôs Law. We design devices whose resistances can be switched from a large number of analogue resistance states based on the principles of electrochemical ion insertion and extraction.</p><p>Yiyang&nbsp;Li completed his BS at Olin College (2011), his PhD at Stanford University (2016), and is currently a postdoc at Sandia National Labs.
