The high energy consumption arises from the inefficiencies of using digital processors for data processing. Inspired by the energy-efficient human brain, we use analogue approaches which are 100-1000 times more energy efficient than optimized digital processors. Here, we compute directly using materials with a known resistance combining Ohm‚Äôs Law and Kirchoff‚Äôs Law. We design devices whose resistances can be switched from a large number of analogue resistance states based on the principles of electrochemical ion insertion and extraction.</p><p>Yiyang&nbsp;Li completed his BS at Olin College (2011), his PhD at Stanford University (2016), and is currently a postdoc at Sandia National Labs. He will start as an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Fall 2020.</p>","location":"https://olin.zoom.us/j/94744460111","start":{"$date":"2020-06-24T19:00:00Z"},"end":{"$date":"2020-06-24T20:00:00Z"},"tag":"clubs"}
